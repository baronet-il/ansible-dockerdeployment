# Ansible Docker Deploy

This is a simple config we use in Baronet (www.baronet.co.il) to deploy our app containers to EC2. This is a good starting point for single container apps, and can fit ok with multiple containers that scale the same.

Deployment *does* include some downtime, so take note of that. This code will probably be phased out as our orchestration needs rise.
